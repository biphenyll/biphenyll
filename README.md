<p align="center"> <sub>im asocial and quiet, and i can be a bit unresponsive when afk or idk wtf i will say. i can come off as dry to ppl im not close to (or im not invested in the convo), but im vry friendly, nonetheless. im also immature and a lil dramatic, maybe a bit overdramatic whn i find out my fave thing is bad or smth... im also low empathetic to ppl im not close to. i forget quite easily, idk maybe im a goldfish irl. OH right, im also afk (almost) all of the time, so feel free to c+h and/or w2i

<p align="center"> <sub>jst like how the othrs explain their humour, mine is also kind of dark. im rly sarcastic all the time and i dont use tonetags unless u ask. i cuss/slur a lot as well, so lmk if u want me to stop.

## $\color{#603252}{Interests}$
<p align="center"> <sub>i only have three main interests, which is: TMNT (spec Rise and 2k12), RanFren, Kocoo Land. I hve other interests but i chose not to mention them, since im kinda inactive in the fandom (and bcus i forgot almost all of them). i dnt talk abt my interests often, bcus (1) i dnt hve headcanons, (2) i dnt binge watch/read em.

<p align="center"> <sub>i mainly listen to MSI and Mother Mother. sometimes Femtanyl, The Caretaker, STOMACH BOOK, Kikuo, MARETU, RITCHRD, Maebi, Yaelokre, Nero's Day at Disneyland, and Pastel Ghost
