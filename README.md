<sub>not rly interactive, will only interact ppl i find interesting or if they start, i dont communicate often and i tend to be a bit unresponsive when busy or idk wtf i will say. i prefer if u start the conversation, i have nothing to talk abt sadly, also prepare for a late to no response if i dont find it interesting and, again, i hve no idea wht i will respond. im dry and low empathetic to almost every1, this might include one of my friends as well (close or not). im always sarcastic, dont take my jks srsly, i dont use tonetags (unless asked). my jks consists of dark humour and wtv humour i stole from ppl, even strangers.

<sub>i mostly stay at the bakery (in/out), sometimes at the bottom of the map (most spec the TMNT area). im also rly laggy, hence why i rarely do erratic movements in pt or move (i get to the bottom of the map by using one of my skins to tp obviously)

<sub>i only have two main interests, TMNT (spec rottmnt & 2k12) and RanFren. my other interests are GOHOME, Garn 47, Crow 64, Iron Lung (game), Squirrel Stapler, Yun Seven's games, ttwoskies, etcetcetc. i dont talk abt any of my interests (including main) cus i rarely watch/read them, and i have no headcanons nor theories either.
