<sub>im colemak/randal idk, im 14 and i use any prns (pref it/its cus im a thing), im aroace and platonically married irl (irrelevant), im also filipino but im more fluent in english, and i hve a prty shitty memory
<sub>im currently devolving and dying inside!

<sub>im not rly interactive, i only approach ppl i find interesting or if they int first, i mostly interact with my friends. im also prty quiet and can be a bit unresponsive, especially to those im friends with (including close friends), i prefer if u start communicating with me first than letting me do it. i hve a very blank mind, ok??????? im prty dry to almost evryone, but im friendly, trust. im also always afk.. so w2i pls, and if i dont respond that means idk wtf i will say, i jst dont want to reply, or im actually busy

<sub>im laggy, hence why i rarely do erratic movement in pt or move my spot at the bakery. im usually seen at the bakery, smtimes at the TMNT area.

<sub>im always sarcastic, i tend to jk abt abuse, death, suicide, and a bit of nsfw and flesh/gore (its jst dark idk ok?). if u dont like these type of jks, jst lemme knw. i hve other jks anyway, but idk how ill explain tht,, i also cuss/slur a lot. i dont use tonetags unless asked. ok thats all

<sub>nvm theres more—i only have two fixations, TMNT and RanFren. i have other interests as well which are GOHOME, Squirrel Stapler, Iron Lung (game), Crow 64, etc etc (i forgot). i dont talk abt my interests, i rarely binge watch/read my interests, i also dont have headcanons nor theories either.
